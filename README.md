## Project Motivation <a name=directories"></>
 
This is the final project of my Udacity training to become a data scientist. The entire training was a lot of fun and I learned a lot and had to apply everything I learned in this project. I hope have fun using the dog breed classifier
 
 ## Directories <a name="directories"></a>

   - templates - directory with HTML files used by the web application
   - respository - directory with trained model and neccessary data for the web application 
   - images - folder where the uploaded pictures where saved temporarily
   - requirements.txt - all python libraries

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

   - Web application:  -dog_breed_application.py`launch a Flask web app to predict dog breed in pictures.
   - Juphyter notebook:-dog_app.ipynb`Workbook of the project, if you have any special interest in more information.
   - Project Overview: -project_overview.pdf`This file provides an Overview how the project was approached.
          
  
## Instructions<a name="instructions"></a>

1.Take care that the link for the image directory in the dog_breed_application is correct
"IMAGE_FOLDER = './images/' # image filepath" 

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python dog_breed_applicaiton.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/

4. Upload a picture and hit the button "Upload image". Your picture will now checked by the algorithm if its rather a dog or human and predicting the most fitting breed.
